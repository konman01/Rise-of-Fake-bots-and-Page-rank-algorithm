"Rise of the fake bots and fall of the Page-rank algorithm"

you have managed to create your master/slave bot architecture and you are acquiring some recognition on the internet, an investor has approached you to hire you and your infrastructure or bots to bias the next election to their top pic. You must add a command to your bot called rise-fake-url and down-fake-url both of which take two parameters: a port number and an URL. Upon receiving the rise-fake-url command your bots will all behave like web servers at the specified port number and serve a virtual html page that will link then to two other virtual html pages, and each page will contain a link to the fake url with a text stating very important, key, "check this out!" and a number of keywords that will make anybody looking at it the link is important. 

A crawler traversing your fake web site will see a binary tree of fake web pages, each one containing 10 links to the fake url given in the comment above. Upon receiving the down command, all fake websites will be brought down by your docile bots which will not even respond to connections on the port below.

Your "angel" investor will take care of injecting links to the fake web sites in the Internet via blogs and social media so as to direct the best crawlers to your bots.
